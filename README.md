## Why I Used Nuxt 3.0

I've had my eyes on Nuxt 3.0 since it was first announced, before it was even fully released, but never had the opportunity to test it out. I thought my portfolio would be a great way to test it out and learn a new technology.

To that end, I decided to add an admin page to add or remove projects from my projects list in order to make full use of what Nuxt has to provide.
